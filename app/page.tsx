            Life resists death. Silicon Valley has transformed longevity activism into a movement. Their "Don't die" slogan becomes protocols: broccoli, pills, and routines promise immortality by spreadsheet. Cybroc answers with a row of broccoli "cyborgs" that train harder than any billionaire bodyâ€”running tiny treadmills, plunging in ice baths, brachiating on servo arms, sled-pushing on timing belts. They perform the rituals of longevity with machine devotion. And then, over days of exhibition, of course, they rot, inevitably. The green floret becomes brown, while the motors keep counting reps. Cybroc is an embodied argument: when we arrogantly attempt to engineer vitality, are we truly extending natural lifeâ€”or merely mechanizing its inevitable decay?

          <h3>/ Concept /</h3>
          <p>
            Cybroc is a series of kinetic art installations exploring the recent proliferating populist longevity activism through the satirical cyborgization of broccoli. The artwork augments the symbol of health foodâ€”broccoliâ€”with prosthetic limbs to perform so-called longevity-enhancing exercises such as cold plunges, treadmill running, brachiation (arm-swinging), sled pushing, simulations of primal human survival tasks reframed as modern fitness routines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite its mechanical augmentations, the broccoli&apos;s inevitable decay and rotting after exhibiting high-intensity performances prompts reflection on the limits of biological enhancement and the ethics of human enhancement beyond natural capabilities, particularly transhumanist ideals. By juxtaposing a symbolic healthy vegetable with cutting-edge concepts of human enhancement, Cybroc challenges viewers to consider the intersection of nature, technology, and the human quest for extended lifespan in our transhuman era.

          <h3>/ Background /</h3>
          <p>
            Populist longevity activism is a proliferating movement led by Silicon Valley&apos;s ultra-wealthy, focusing on promoting research, policies, and practices aimed at extending human lifespan and healthspan. For example, billionaire Bryan Johnson is dedicating significant efforts to this cause, promoting his &ldquo;Blueprint&rdquo; protocol to reverse aging.
          </p>
          <p>
            The leading role of our piece, broccoli, a well-known symbol of healthy food, also makes many appearances in his recipes. However, the transhumanist promise of extending life and enhancing human capabilities is critiqued for its potential to exacerbate social inequalities. The ethical considerations surrounding human augmentation, particularly regarding the alteration of human nature, raise concerns about the potential consequences for individual identity and societal values.
